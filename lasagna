# Lasagna

## Ingredients

- 100g gryère
- 1 onion
- 600g of bolognaise sauce
- Lasagna paste
- 350g of beef meat
- béchamel 

## preparation 

Step 1 
Cut onion into small pieces and sauté in olive oil.
Step 2 
When the onions have browned, add the 350g ground steak.
Step 3 
Cook over medium heat, then add the Bolognese sauce.
Step 4 
Prepare the béchamel sauce. Melt butter over high heat.
Step 5 
Once melted, add the two tablespoons of flour and stir with a whisk over medium heat.
Step 6 
When the mixture is smooth (very quickly), gradually add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
Step 7
Continue stirring until the béchamel thickens.
Step 8 
Mix the Bolognese sauce made earlier with the béchamel sauce.
Step 9 
Pour a layer of this mixture into a gratin dish, then cover with lasagne dough. Repeat until all the sauce is used up (about 2 times).
Step 10 
The last layer should be a layer of sauce. Add the grated Gruyère and bake for approx. 45 min at 180° (th.6).
Step 11 
To check if the lasagne is cooked, prick it with a knife. The lasagne pasta should be melting, so the knife should go in easily.
